# diypowerwall
I've spent a lot of time in search of a perfect PCB for a large powerwall to ultimately power a house and go off-grid, and in my attempts I have come across great projects and resources, despite how awesome they are.. they either don't fit my exact design ideas or plans, or the expense is too high. Some free, open source, or even paid-for projects that once were open source create small 12 or 24 volt systems and use components that cost more to create a 48v design than the parts needed to begin with it. 

Since this is a huge and popular subject for many DIY'ers, eBikers, and those looking for more self-sufficent lifestyles, tiny homes, preppers, etc. I understand it's not exactly a cheap thing to do. Upwards of 5,000 USD for batteries alone not including things like cables, inverters, chargers and panels or even turbines -- I am setting out to create a full fledged manual on a 48v system to power a home.

This project will always be open source. Always be free.
